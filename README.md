# mesh-os

The intention of Mesh OS is to streamline and simplify the interaction of various types of IoT devices based on the Arduino platform. This is based in  C/C++ but can compile to be transmitted via a serial port to any of the Arduino micro controllers. 

This is meant to act as a baseline library with embedded functions such as sampling of all the connected sensors, storage to a microSD chip and many others.

More documentation coming soon.
